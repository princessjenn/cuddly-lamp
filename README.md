# Challenge 06 Weather Application

## Description
With dynamically updated HTML and CSS, the content of the weather app can change based on user actions, such as clicking a button or filling out a form. For example, I used JavaScript to dynamically update the text of a heading/paragraph, to hide certain elements on the page based on user input.
